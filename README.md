# DLAssignment2
We have total 6 code files for all the questions
# Part A:
# Question 1 : DL_Assignment2_PartA(Q1)
Here just run the code as it is cell by cell, we have spearated all the scetions, make changes in parameter at the last scetion and run the fit function.
# Question 2 : DL_Assignment2_PartA(Q2)
Here again run all the sections , but  execution the Data Augmentation section will lead to very long running time while model training, skip this section (simply don't run). still code will run fine. We havge created a scetion named "Section of Code to run faster for checking correctness(without wandb)" run this section to check if our code is working currectly or not.Next Section contains wandb sections and sweep functions.Login to wandb and change the authentication ids where required , then it will also run.Al the outputs are available in the output sections.
# Question 4 : DL_Assignment2_PartA(Q4)
For this part again we have created different sections.Simply run one by one and also please note that executing Data Augmentation section will lead to 4* number of data points...so execution time will be very high
# question 5: Guided_backprop :-
simply run the code, nothing required

# Part B:
# Question 1: DL_Assignment2_PartB(Q1) 
Here we have mentioned all the parts in code sections, in the second last section by chaning model_type we can fine tune different pretrained models.
# Question 3: DL_Assignment2_PartA(Q2)
Similar code just like earlier but here wandb is required , need to login with wandb ids, and code can be run.outputs are also shown in our notebooks.
